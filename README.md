Project Title: C++ Vector with Iterator Project

Description:

This C++ project showcases the implementation of a dynamic array using the standard template library (STL) vector and iterator. The vector class is augmented with custom functionalities, allowing for dynamic resizing, insertion, deletion, and traversal through the use of iterators.

Key Features:

    Vector Implementation: Utilizes the power of C++ vectors to manage a dynamic array efficiently.
    Iterator Functionality: Implements iterators for seamless traversal and manipulation of vector elements.
    Dynamic Resizing: Automatic resizing of the vector when the number of elements exceeds its capacity.
    Insertion and Deletion: Functions for adding and removing elements from specified positions in the vector.
    

How to Use:

    Clone the repository to your local machine.
    Compile the C++ source files using your preferred compiler.
    Run the executable to see the vector functionalities in action.
